  The club organises a range of field meets throughout the season, catering to both longwings and shortwings. These events are open to all members and are generously subsidised by the club, with a nominal fee of just Â£35 per person. Depending on numbers, members are also welcome to spectate free of charge.
  <br><br>Our meetings are informal and relaxed, filled with friendly banter, exciting sport, and a great sense of camaraderie. Everyone is supportive, making it a welcoming environment for both seasoned falconers and newcomers alike.
