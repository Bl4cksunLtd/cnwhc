  The best way to learn more about the club or become a member is by attending one of our meetings, held at <b>8pm on the first Tuesday of each month</b>. Itâ€™s a great opportunity to meet fellow members, discover more about the club, and sign up in person. Guests are welcome to attend up to two meetings for free before deciding to join.
